# COVID-19 MISP Information Sharing Community


COVID-19 MISP is a MISP instance retrofitted for a COVID-19 information sharing community.

The information sharing community is focusing on two areas of sharing:

- Medical information
- Cyber threats related to / abusing COVID-19

The information sharing community has a low barrier of entry, everyone can contribute and use the data. By default, the information is classified as TLP:WHITE for a larger distribution and usefulness.

## Who is the target audience for this community ?

- Anyone wanting to gain situational awareness for the current COVID-19 situation
- Security practitioners trying to fend off covid related attacks
- Those wanting to share, collaborate, visualise, automate data
- All data is contextualised as either medical or security related information for easy filtering

## Why using MISP in such context?

- We are obviously interested on a personal level, as is everyone
- Information sharing is what we do anyway
- The tools that we are building are expanding our capabilities for the future
- Bridging different domains affected in different ways can reveal correlations

## How to get access to the COVID-19 MISP

Access can be requested to CIRCL by sending an email to [CIRCL](mailto:info@circl.lu). A self-registration link will be available very soon.
