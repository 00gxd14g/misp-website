MISP is not only a software but also a series of data models created by the MISP community. MISP includes a simple and practical information sharing format expressed in JSON that can be used with MISP software or by any other software.

## MISP Core Format

### MISP default attributes and categories

## MISP Taxonomies

Along with the core format, [MISP taxonomies](https://www.github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/) provide a set of already defined classifications modeling estimative language, CSIRTs/CERTs classifications, national classifications or threat model classification. The fixed taxonomies provide a practical method to tag efficiently events and attributes within a set of MISP instances where taxonomies can be easily cherry-picked or extended to meet the local requirements of an organization or a specific sharing community. When using MISP, the MISP taxonomies are available and can be freely used based on the community practises.
