# MISP Professional Services

MISP Professional Services (MPS) is a program handled by the lead development team of MISP Project, in order to offer highly 
skilled services around MISP and to support the sustainability of the MISP project.
We also address companies whose policy allows Open Source Software products only if there is commercial support service 
available.

In addition to the best-effort support available through these (support channels)[/documentation/#community-support/], 
our MISP Professional Services are meant to be used by companies and organisations who want to make sure their issues are 
fast-tracked and receive higher importance.

The following MISP Professional Services are available: 

## Trainings

The MISP Project team is very experienced doing specific trainings for small groups and larger organisations and audiences, 
either at our location or at a specified location of the organisation taking the training.
We are flexible on the content and can adopt it to the level of expertise of the participants if required.
Most of the time we are doing sessions of 1 to 3 days, with raising level of technical experience each day.
The training is always held by two of our MISP core team.

The MISP team gives frequently open trainings within their premises in Luxembourg and sometimes abroad.
A list of current trainings can be found at the [events page](/events/).

There are different ways of custom trainings:

a) For on-site closed trainings up to 30-50 attendees (depending on conditions of the location): 
We charge EUR 3.000 per training day. 

b) For closed trainings up to 30 attendees in Luxembourg: 
We charge EUR 3.500 per training day including food and beverages
