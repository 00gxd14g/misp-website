## Download and Install MISP

[MISP source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) including documentation and scripts for installation.

### Requirements

MISP can be easily installed on any standard GNU/Linux distribution. Installation guides for various distributions are included in the [INSTALL directory](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/2.4/INSTALL). If you did a git clone of MISP for the installation, an [UPDATE procedure is available](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/INSTALL/UPDATE.txt) to keep your MISP up-to-date.
