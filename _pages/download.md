## Download and Install MISP

[MISP source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) including documentation and scripts for installation.

### Requirements

MISP can be easily installed on any standard GNU/Linux distribution. Installation guides for various distributions are included in the [INSTALL directory](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/2.4/INSTALL). If you did a git clone of MISP for the installation, an [UPDATE procedure is available](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/INSTALL/UPDATE.txt) to keep your MISP up-to-date.

### Virtual images

If you would like to test MISP and don't want to do an installation, CIRCL provides [VirtualBox images with MISP pre-installed for training](https://www.circl.lu/services/misp-training-materials/#misp-virtual-machine). The image can be used for production but we highly recommend to change the default credentials and salt pre-configured with such images.

### Docker container

A [docker container for MISP](https://github.com/xme/misp-docker) is maintained by Xavier Mertens.

## License

MISP is an open source and free software released under the AGPL (Affero General Public License). We are committed to ensure that MISP will remain a free and open source project on the long-run.
