## Software and Tools

Many open source and proprietary tools integrate MISP support (MISP format or API) in order to extend their tools
or MISP itself. A series of additional software are supported and handled by the [MISP project](https://www.github.com/MISP).
The additional software supported by the MISP project allow the community to rely on additional tools to support their day-to-day operations. The objective
is also to explore new ideas, concepts or functionality which can be integrated in MISP core software later on.

### Software created by the MISP project

- [misp-modules](https://github.com/MISP/misp-modules) - Modules for expansion services in MISP
     - Passive Total - [doc](http://blog.passivetotal.org/misp-sharing-done-differently/).
     - CIRCL Passive DNS - a hover and expansion module to expand hostname and IP addresses with passive DNS information.
     - CIRCL Passive SSL - a hover and expansion module to expand IP addresses with the X.509 certificate seen.
     - EUPI API Support (Phishing Initiative project).
     - IPASN - a hover and expansion to get the BGP ASN of an IP address.
     - ASN History - a hover and expansion module to expand an AS number with the ASN description and its history.
     - CVE a hover module to give more information about a vulnerability (CVE).
- [Viper](http://www.viper.li/) - is a binary management and analysis framework dedicated to malware and exploit researchers including a MISP module.
- [misp-workbench](https://github.com/MISP/misp-workbench) - Tools to export data out of the MISP MySQL database and use and abuse them outside of this platform.
