# MISP Communities

MISP is an open source software and it's also a large community of MISP users creating, maintaining and operating communities of users or organizations sharing information about threats or cyber security indicators worldwide. The MISP project doesn't maintain an exhaustive list of all communities relying on MISP especially that some communities use MISP internally or privately.
