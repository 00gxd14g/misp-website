## MISP Communities

MISP is an open source software and it's also a large community of MISP users creating, maintaining and operating communities of users or organizations sharing information about threats or cyber security indicators worldwide. The MISP project doesn't maintain an exhaustive list of all communities relying on MISP especially that some communities use MISP internally or privately.

# Existing communities

Each communities might have specific rules to join them. Take a look and feel free to contact the respective communities that fit your organization. Some of existing public communities might be interconnected and some might be in an island mode. By running MISP, these communities usually allow their members to connect using the MISP API, MISP user-interface or even to synchronize your MISP instance with their communities.
