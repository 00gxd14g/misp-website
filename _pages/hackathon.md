# Open Source Security hackathon - Monday 25th October 2021 and Tuesday 26th October 2021

![](/assets/images/stack.jpg)

[CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/) in collaboration with the [MISP Project](https://www.misp-project.org/) is organising the 5th Open Source Security Software Hackathon, which will take place over two days, on Monday 25th October 2021 and Tuesday 26th October 2021.

# Monday 25th October 2021 - Topic: Security Orchestration

The first day of the virtual hackathon aims to solve several pending problems revolving around security orchestration. The plan is for organisations to come together and improve existing / in progress open source projects dealing with orchestration (such as [Cerebrate](https://github.com/cerebrate-project)) as well as serve as a playground to integrate the various tools with one another. We are happy to host any groups working on alternative orchestration tools for this day as well as teams that would like to see their tools receive connectors in Cerebrate and other orchestration tools.

# Tuesday 26th October 2021 - Topic: Open Source Security at large

The virtual Hackathon of Tuesday is dedicated to free/open source software in the field of cybersecurity. The aim is to gather various developer groups and offer them the opportunity to collaborate on challenging programming problems in the field of cybersecurity. The topics will include information sharing, network/system forensics, data mining challenges and network/computer exploitation or defense. The objective of the Open Source Security Software hackathon is also to improve the interoperability and data exchange between the different security tools.

# Practical details

The hackathon will take place in cyberspace and it's free of charge.

## Registration

{% include hackathon.html %}

## Register your project

If you want to have your project listed, please send the name, logo and a brief description of your project to info@circl.lu in order to be listed. The only requirements are that your project is:

- released under an open source license (OSI or FSF approved) and
- that it is a project in the security field.

## Core principles

The hackathon is not a competition, it’s an opportunity for open source and free software developers to work together on interesting ideas, projects or collaborations. The goal is to welcome newcomers (especially to help them get started) as well as established contributors of the various projets. Code is one aspect of the hackathon, but documentation, website presence, presentation materials and design are also important to open source and free software projects in information security.

## Agenda

As this is a hackathon, there is no strict agenda. This helps with avoiding interruptions to the work on specific problems or projects and ensures that the hacking on the various problems and ideas progresses smoothly. Nevertheless a global etherpad will be provided to keep track of all the activities and projects ongoing during these two days.

## Participating Organisations

## Supporting Organisations

Security orchestration hackathon is supported by the EC under “Connecting Europe Facility – Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure Maintenance and Evolution of Core Service Platform Cooperation Mechanism for CSIRTs – MeliCERTes Facility” ([SMART 2018/1024](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/open-platforms-collaborate-cyber-threats)).

## Participating Projects

**You don’t need to be an already existing member, core member, owner or otherwise linked to an open source project in order to participate to the hackaton.**

The projects listed are merely examples and you’re more than welcome to propose other open source projects you would like to work on.
