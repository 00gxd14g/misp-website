# MISP Model of Governance

MISP project is a significantly large open source project with the goal to make practicable tools and format to improve information sharing at large.
In order to reach our goal, MISP project gathers feature requests, feedback and bug reports from different sources. As described in the graph below,
we have different sources including MISP user-groups, direct community feedback via GitHub, MISP trainings and the yearly MISP summit.
