A new version of MISP [2.4.70](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.70) has been released including new features, improvements and important bug fixes.

- A significant improvement has been introduced in MISP user-interface to make it [better accessible](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/2038) especially for visually impaired users.
- API improvement introduced to add several attributes in one go.
- API extended to support the add and edit MISP servers.
- A simple update feature from the user-interface was introduced to ease the update process of MISP.
- New attribute types (hex, sigma and impfuzzy) have been introduced for new misp-objects and better support to the new [sigma format](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma). Sigma format is generic signature format for SIEM Systems. This new attribute will help the development of sigma converter via misp-modules.
- Test and diagnostic for MISP server synchronisation has been significantly improved.  The old legacy and mangle sync for very old MISP instance (2.3) has been removed to make the code cleaner and improve the synchronisation process with recent MISP instances.

Many other bugs fixed and minor features added.
