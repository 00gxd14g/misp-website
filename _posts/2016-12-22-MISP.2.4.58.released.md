A new version of MISP [2.4.58](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.58) has been released, including bug fixes and a specific improvement in the correlation feature.

Correlation can be disabled at instance level, event level or event at attribute level by the site admin or the creator of the event. The feature is an optional feature that can be enabled or disabled system-wide in MISP. This allows a flexible scheme for events where correlating values are not interesting for the analysts. The feature is also available via the API.

The release includes various improvements such as:

- [Galaxy] bug fixes and improvement to the UI based on users feedback.
- Fuzzy_Hash_Value export added in STIX/CybOX.
- LDAP authentication improved to get role from LDAP.
- Some minor bug fixes and updates.

A big thank to all the users who gave feedback and contributors who helped us improve MISP.
