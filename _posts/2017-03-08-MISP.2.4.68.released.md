A new version of MISP [2.4.68](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.68) has been released including multiple bug fixes and improvements.

Improvements and features added:

- Enable sync permissions for read-only accounts.
- Upload org logo can now be performed via the org edit/view interface.
- An option to disable cached export has been added for low disk space servers.

Blacklisting of deleted events is now enabled by default. This feature exists but was not enabled by default. This feature allows MISP users to
ensure that deleted events to never come back on their instance. The blacklisting list can be easily managed from the MISP interface. As this
feature is a default behavior that the majority of MISP community needs, the feature is now enabled by default starting from 2.4.68.

Many bugs were fixes in this release especially a specific speed improvement in the delete process.

For the ongoing work on [misp-objects](https://github.com/MISP/misp-objects), a new float type has been added to support additional composite objects.
We welcome contribution to the misp-objects design and ideas to ensure a consistent set of objects for the next release.
