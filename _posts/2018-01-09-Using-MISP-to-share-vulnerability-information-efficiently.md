# Using MISP to share vulnerability information efficiently

Software and hardware vulnerability are often discussed, shared, prepared, analysed or reviewed before publication. This process
can be tedious as this is often a lot of exchanges between the parties involved including reporters, proxy-reporters, coordinators,
editor and even impacted parties. Some vulnerabilities might be shared and exchanged within trusted parties for months before being
officially disclosed. This can generate a significant workload on a staff dealing with security team, vulnerability assessment team or
CNA (CVE Numbering Authorities).

As MISP provides a complete functionality software for sharing information, sharing and collaborating on security vulnerabilities
within a trusted group is as easy as sharing indicators.

## MISP Objects

MISP objects provide a flexible way to describe combined information using a simple templating system. There is already a vulnerability
object which covers the most common cases used by organisations such as CSIRTs, security team or security assessment team. But if you
have a specific use-case of vulnerability information to share, a MISP object can be built from a template in a matter of minutes.

# How to share vulnerability information within MISP to a trusted group

Sharing a set of vulnerabilities to a trusted group is straightforward. First you create an event which will contain one or more
vulnerability with the corresponding sharing group. An event is just a container with meta-data associated to it such as classification
or a generic description.

Then when your event is created, the event can be used to attach attributes or objects. If you want to share vulnerability information,
a vulnerability object can be added to describe the vulnerability.

The vulnerability object is composed of various attributes such as vulnerable configuration where it's expressed as a CPE value and
can be added multiple times if you have different vulnerable configurations.
