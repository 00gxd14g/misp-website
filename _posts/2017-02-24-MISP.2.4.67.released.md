A new version of MISP [2.4.67](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.67) has been released, including improvements in sighting feature, user management and activity visualisation.

Sighting activity over tags and taxonomy usage are now visible with a sparkline and giving an interesting outlook of contextual activity:

Advanced sighting activity is now available at event level to view the summary of sighting done at attribute level.

Significant updates to the user-management interface has been done allowing user to see their respective organisation admin, PGP status overview including fingerpring and validity of the key.
These improvements were introduced following the feedback of some MISP administrators operating large information sharing communities.

Many bugs fixed and small improvement were added.

A big thank to all the users who gave feedback and contributors who helped us improve MISP. A special dedication to the users who are not afraid of doing pull-request on the
various MISP projects (from core to taxonomies) to improve MISP and support the growing community of users.

The full change log is available [here](https://www.misp.software/Changelog.txt).
