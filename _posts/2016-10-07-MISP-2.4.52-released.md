We are glad to announce MISP 2.4.52 including new features, improvements and bug fixes.

The following new features were introduced:

 - Freetext feed import: a flexible scheme to import any feed available on Internet and incorporate them automatically in MISP. The feed imported can create new event or update an existing event. The freetext feed feature permits to preview the import and quickly integrates external sources.
