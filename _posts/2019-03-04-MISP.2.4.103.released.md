A new version of MISP ([2.4.103](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.103)) has been released with significant UI improvements (a new flexible attribute filtering tool at event level), many bug fixes and a fix to a security vulnerability which was affecting sighting visibility.

# New features

## Improved attribute filtering tool

A new attribute filtering tool has been added to the event view to replace the previous filtering. Complex filtering rules can
be set to easily filter, navigate and paginate over large events with many attributes and objects.

## Generic matrix-like galaxies are now supported

With the increase use of MITRE ATT&CK and the need of describing similar matrix-like models. Generic matrix-like galaxies are now supported
to create your own matrix with the associated custom kill chains. A first new model has been added to MISP called *Universal Development and Security Guidelines as Applicable to Election Technology* made by the European Commission to model the attack model against election processes and technologies.


# Security fix


## Enhancements

Many bugs were fixed and various small improvements were performed.

MISP [galaxy](/galaxy.pdf), [objects](/objects.pdf) and [taxonomies](/taxonomies.pdf) were extended by many contributors. These are also included by default in MISP. Don't forget to do a `git submodule update` and update galaxies, objects and taxonomies via the UI.

We would like to thank all the contributors, reporters and users who have helped us in the past months to improve MISP and information sharing at large.

As always, a detailed and [complete changelog is available](http://www.misp-project.org/Changelog.txt) with all the fixes, changes and improvements.

Don't hesitate to have a look at our [events page](http://www.misp-project.org/events/) to see our next trainings, talks and activities to improve threat intelligence, analytics and automation.
