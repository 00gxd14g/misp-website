# New features

## Summary email notification

be used when encryption cannot be enabled and organisations still require email alerting.

Thanks to the reporters including Nicolas Vidal from TEHTRIS.

# Various improvements

- [OpenAPI] - Missing return formats added to the documentation
- [server caching] only push data to redis / logs if there's something to push
