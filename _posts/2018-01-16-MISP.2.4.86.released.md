A new version of MISP [2.4.86](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.86) has been released including improvement in the sharing groups and their API, improved granular of modules visibility on instance-level and many bug fixes.

There are different usages of MISP especially in large information sharing and exchange communities such as ISACs (e.g. [X-ISAC](https://www.x-isac.org/) or similar organisations. Two main new features were introduced to better support such use:

- An optional feature to limit the visibility of organisations has been added where only site admins and sharing groups can see the full organisation lists. This is a disabled option by default but can be enabled if this is required in your use-case. Keep in mind sharing groups managers can still see the full list of organisations (it's by design as required to expand and create sharing groups).
- An additional setting in the modules (expansion, import, export) allow to limit the accessibility of a module to a specific organisation. This is quite useful when specific expansion services are limited to a single organisations such as services restricted due API keys restriction or access to specific sensitive services (e.g. ticketing systems, SIEMs lookup,...)

Sharing groups are now manageable via the API allowing creation and management of sharing groups to other applications.

A significant performance improvement (a gain of 50% is quite common) when importing large batch of attributes into MISP via the UI or the API. Another performance gain
is the attribute index and search by a factor of 10 due to some silly MySQL indexing behaviors.

Many bug fixes and improvement were introduced in this version.

The full change log is available [here](https://www.misp.software/Changelog.txt). [PyMISP change log](https://www.misp.software/PyMISP-Changelog.txt) is also available.

In addition, [MISP dashboard](https://github.com/MISP/misp-dashboard) has been significantly improved and can be installed together in one or more MISP instances.

PyMISP has been refactored and improved. The PyMISP documentation has been updated [PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pymisp/latest/pymisp.pdf).

MISP [galaxy](/galaxy.pdf), [objects](/objects.pdf) and [taxonomies](/taxonomies.pdf) were notably extended by many contributors. These are also included by default in MISP. Don't forget to do a `git submodule update` and update galaxies, objects and taxonomies via the UI.

MISP trainings are foreseen the 17/01 and 18/01 in Luxembourg including a full-day API and extension hands-on session.

We have also many other trainings (Vienna in February) and events foreseen in 2018, [for more information](/events/)
