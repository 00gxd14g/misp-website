# MISP 2.4.149 released

MISP 2.4.149 released including many bugs fixed along with some new and improved functionalities

# New features

- first stage of a massive rework of our STIX integration
- Various improvements to the integration with Cerebrate

# New STIX libraries

- The first version of a long ongoing project to rework our entire STIX integration has finally been merged, thanks to the tireless work of @chrisr3d
- Our converter libraries have embarked on a path of their own, becoming a standalone repository included by default in MISP, but also serving as a useful tool for anyone looking for a clean way of converting between the MISP standard format and various STIX versions (1.1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1).
- The libraries are still work in progress, but continuously improved, follow [misp-stix](https://github.com/MISP/misp-stix)
- Included is also a detailed documentation, which also serves as a knowledge base for the mapping between the two formats, available under the [documentation](https://github.com/MISP/misp-stix/tree/main/documentation) sub-directory
- From this release on, you have more control over which STIX version is used when exporting STIX data from MISP, by specifying the "stix_version" to be returned (supported versions for STIX 1: 1.1.1 and 1.2. For STIX 2: 2.0 and 2.1)

# Cerebrate integration

- Allow the fetching of sharing group data from Cerebrate instances, our new open source tool in development aiming to solve a host of issues revolving around community management and orchestration. Our first official release of the tool is scheduled for the MISP summit coming up this month
- To follow the cerebrate project, head over to its [github page](https://github.com/cerebrate-project/cerebrate)
- For the MISP summit to be held on the 21st of October, don't forget to [register](https://www.misp-project.org/misp-summit)


# Various improvements

- A long list of improvements, massive thanks to @JakubOnderka for the continuous stream of improvements and quality of life changes
- Thanks to the work of @righel, our OpenAPI documentation is becoming more and more complete, now covering a long list of the more exotic endpoints and options
