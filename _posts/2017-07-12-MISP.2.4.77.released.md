A new version of MISP [2.4.77](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.77) has been released including security fixes, bug fixes and various improvements.

This version includes multiple security fixes reported by cert.govt.nz including:

- Some security settings including GnuPG password for the signing keys of the MISP notification or redis passwords are now redacted from the server setting.
- Sanitisation of the filenames has been tightening in the template uploader.
- Avoid GFI uploader code to throw exceptions (in debug mode) on failed parsing and give a proper a warning.
- Hashing algorithm updated to bcrypt for new users and updated transparently for existing users at the next login.
- All profile edit pages now require the user's or admin's password to be confirmed to limit the impact on potential session hijacking.

A significant speed improvement on the feed pull has been done for the CSV/freetext import especially for very large feeds.

Screenshots are now included in search results to better support users actively sharing images artefacts using MISP.

Many small and visual improvements were introduced.

MISP taxonomies, galaxy and PyMISP updated to the latest version. New default feeds (e.g. dataplane.org) have been added.

The full change log is available [here](https://www.misp.software/Changelog.txt).
