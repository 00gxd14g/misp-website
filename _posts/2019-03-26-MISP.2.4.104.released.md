A new version of MISP ([2.4.104](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.104)) has been released with a series of new features such as new overlap feed comparator, a new graph visualisation o
f event and attribute distribution, bookmarked history in REST client and many others.

# New features

## New overlap feed comparator

Feed can now be compared to other feeds (cached feeds and cached MISP servers). This helps if you can cover the contents with a combination of other cached feeds. This feature can be useful 
to carefully evaluate new feeds against other ones.

## Distribution graph

A new distribution visualisation graph has been introduced to quickly view where information will be distributed. This allows users to get an overview how far events and attributes will be d
istributed and shows the member of the community who will get the information shared.

## Bookmark and history in REST client

The MISP UI REST Client now keeps an history of all the queries performed. The queries can be recalled and bookmarked for later use. No more need to keep track of your queries in your notes,
 it's now in your MISP instance.

A host of bugs were squashed and various small improvements were implemented.

MISP [galaxy](/galaxy.pdf), [objects](/objects.pdf), [taxonomies](/taxonomies.pdf) and [warning-lists](https://www.github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists) were extended by many contributors, whic
h are also included by default in MISP. Don't forget to run a `git submodule update` and update galaxies, objects and taxonomies via the UI.

We would like to thank all the contributors, reporters and users who have helped us in the past months to improve MISP and information sharing at large.

As always, a detailed and [complete changelog is available](http://www.misp-project.org/Changelog.txt) with all the fixes, changes and improvements.

Don't hesitate to have a look at our [events page](http://www.misp-project.org/events/) to see our next trainings, talks and activities to improve threat intelligence, analytics and automati
on.
