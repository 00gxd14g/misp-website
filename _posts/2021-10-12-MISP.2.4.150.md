# MISP 2.4.150 released

MISP 2.4.150 released, including a new CA bundle to combat the issues with the Letsencrypt root CA expiration. This is a follow-up release to 2.4.149 and has no other major changes besides pointing to our own repository of the framework that includes the new CA bundle.

# Sync issues due to the expiration of a Letsencrypt root CA

As described in their [blog post](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/#:~:text=On%20September%2030%202021%2C%20there,accept%20your%20Let's%20Encrypt%20certificate), Letsencrpyt had to retire an old Root CA, meaning that that SSL connections when synchronising MISP with other instances would fail if the remote side used letsencrypt. This update includes a new CA bundle that should help you avoid any issues with this.# Acknowledgement
