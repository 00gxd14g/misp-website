A new version of MISP [2.4.92](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.92) has been released including performance improvement, improvements and bug fixes.

We received feedback from various users about the impact on performance when the [MISP warning-lists](http://www.github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists/) are enabled (a feature allowing to detect and filter false positives from attributes in MISP).  The performance issue with warning-lists has been resolved in a way that today enabling warning-lists will barely have impact when viewing or browsing events. We hope this performance improvement will increase the adoption of the warning-lists at large.

A benchmarking tool has been added to the AppModel allowing to easily spot performance issue in the application. Aggregate execution time, number of iterations or peaked memory usage can be easily spotted in order to smooth debugging within MISP.

API has been improved to allow objects to be added via template UUID and version.

A new role permission to publish to the ZMQ pub-sub channel has been added (as kindly requested by our favorite user who regularly sends us horse heads). This role allows to enable or disable ZMQ publishing per user.

The flash message system has been rewrote from scratch allowing a cleaner approach relying on bootstrap's internals with 3 different levels of notification.

Allow hard delete of attributes who were never published to avoid any leak of sensitive information via soft deleted attributes.

Two security vulnerabilities were fixed: [CVE-2018-11245](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-11245) and [CVE-2018-11562](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-11562).  Thanks to the reporters Jarek Kozluk from zbp.pl and Dawid Czarnecki. Don't hesitate to contact us for [reporting vulnerabilities](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-security-vulnerabilities), we love those contributions.

STIX 1 and STIX 2 export and import moved to Python 3 (don't forget to update the dependencies). STIX 1 export has been improved to include additional objects such X.509 certificate and MISP objects. STIX 1 import has been improved for email, whois, and artifact objects along with tags journal entries. STIX 2 export improved regkey object parsing, ip|port and custom object export.

The full change log is available [here](https://www.misp.software/Changelog.txt). [PyMISP change log](https://www.misp.software/PyMISP-Changelog.txt) is also available.

A huge thanks to all the [contributors](/contributors) who helped us to improve the software and also all the participants in MISP training which always give intere
PyMISP has been also updated, boasting a more clever approach to timestamp handling while updating MISP JSON files. The PyMISP documentation has been updated [PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pymisp/latest/pymisp.pdf). [MISP standard Internet-Drafts](https://github.com/MISP/misp-rfc) have been updated and published.

MISP [galaxy](/galaxy.pdf), [objects](/objects.pdf) and [taxonomies](/taxonomies.pdf) were notably extended by many contributors. These are also included by default in MISP. Don't forget to do a `git submodule update` and update galaxies, objects and taxonomies via the UI.

Don't forget that the MISP Threat Intelligence Summit 0x4 will take place the Monday 15th October 2018 before hack.lu 2018. A [Call-for-Papers is open](https://cfp.hack.lu/misp0x4/) for the MISP Threat Intelligence Summit 0x4. We would be glad to see users, contributors or organisations actively using MISP or/and threat intelligence to share their experiences and presentation to the CfP.
