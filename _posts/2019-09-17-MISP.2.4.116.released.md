# MISP 2.4.116 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.116](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.116)) with a major new feature for decaying indicators, new ATT&CK sightings export and a new sync priority capability.

## Major new feature - decaying indicators

After some years of gathering requirements, doing [some research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11052) and implementation, MISP 2.4.116 finally includes [a new extensive feature for Decaying of Indicators with MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/2019/09/12/Decaying-Of-Indicators.html) using an improved model to expire indicators based on custom and shareable models.

The feature allows MISP users to have a simple yet customisable system to automatically (or in some cases manually) mark an Indicator Of Compromise (or more generically, an Attribute) as expired. The expiration feature allows to overlay in real-time computer score on all attributes that have been mapped to a decaying model. The feature has been designed to not change the attributes per se but to extend the meta information available about the attribute. The feature is accessible via the user-interface but also via the API to allow the filtering of attributes based on a decaying model.

The feature is exhaustive and we highly recommend to read the [blog post and watch the video of the complete new feature](https://www.misp-project.org/2019/09/12/Decaying-Of-Indicators.html) or [the slides from the MISP training](https://www.misp-project.org/misp-training/a.5-decaying-indicators.pdf). As usual with MISP project, MISP comes with a set of default decaying model which can be expanded locally or contributed back to the community at large.

## ATT&CK sighting

More and more users and communities are using the ATT&CK framework to contextualise information shared within MISP. The fine team of [ATT&CK recently created a format to share the sightings](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/sightings/) associated with the techniques. MISP 2.4.116 now has a new output format available which allows to export the sighting format and share it back to the community or with MITRE to give insights about the techniques frequently used.

## New sync priority

When having a lot of MISP server to sync with, you might want to prioritise the sync for specific communities or MISP instance. In 2.4.116, we introduced the ability to order the priority of the sync between MISP instances.

# Acknowledgement
