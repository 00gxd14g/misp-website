# MISP 2.4.110 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.110](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.110)) has been released with a host of new features, improvements, many bugs fixed and one security fix. Even if this is summer time, the MISP project works under the warm weather while drinking cocktails (with or without booze).

# New main features

## MISP modules extended to support the full MISP standard format

[misp-modules](misp-modules) now supports MISP objects and relationships. The old modules are still compatible and the new modules bolster up the complete MISP standard format. New modules such as [url-haus](https://github.com/MISP/misp-modules/blob/52dadd2df32b19241fdd978e50b717f1967e264b/misp_modules/modules/expansion/urlhaus.py), [joe sandbox query](https://github.com/MISP/misp-modules/blob/be61613da4f5dc8f082a7c1a9e1ec07fdb872560/misp_modules/modules/expansion/joesandbox_query.py) and many others include the new MISP standard format. This new feature allows to provide more advanced modules generating MISP objects and associated relationships from any kind of expansion, import or export modules in one click.

## Local tags introduced

The long awaited feature "local tags" is now available. You can create tags locally if you are a host org user that in-place tagging for synchronisation and export filtering. MISP events are not modified while using the local tags. Local tags are always stripped before being synchronised with our MISP instances and sharing communities. Local tags allow organisation users to violate the ownership model of MISP and add local tagging to any event or attribute. Local tagging works on tags, galaxies and matrix-like galaxy such as ATT&CK.


## New Norwegian translation

Thanks to the contribution from [Kortho](https://github.com/Kortho), MISP user-interface includes a Norwegian translation. MISP includes Japanese, French translation and multiple translations are growing such as Russian, German and Chinese. If you want to contribute, feel free to join the [crowdin page for MISP](https://crowdin.com/project/misp). It's simple and efficient, translation can be easily done via the web interface.

# Various updates and improvements

- [Following SANS courses feedback](https://twitter.com/speshulted/status/1141711388617904128), physics can be enabled/disabled on demand.
- [UI] Filter has been added in the template object index.
- [API] On-demand inclusion of attribute relations via the event view endpoint. Thanks to Siemens for the ideas and feedback.
- [security] Made certain settings modifiable via the CLI only. Some settings are too risky to be exposed, even to site admins, so made them CLI accessible only.
- [API] New option to excludeLocalTags to events/restSearch.
- [UI] Many improvements in the event view regarding related events. In case of multiple correlations, the related events are now in a scrollable box.
- [Doc] Installation guides and scripts were improved.
- [Bug] Fix an old hard-coded path for the temp directory.
- [API] Simple worker management added.

# Security fix (CVE-2019-12868)

[https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-12868](CVE-2019-12868) has been fixed in MISP 2.4.110. MISP 2.4.109 had remote command execution by a super administrator because the PHP file_exists function is used with user-controlled entries, and phar:// URLs trigger deserialization. This vulnerability can only be triggered by the site admin.

# STIX improvements

- Parsing observable compositions from external STIX files.
- Fixing issues with 'parse' called on bundles containing custom objects.
- Fixed user account pattern and user account observable extension in STIX 2.0 export.
- Fixed socket extension parsing.
- Fixed registry-key keys and values parsing for patterns.

[MISP galaxy](https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html), [MISP object templates](https://www.misp-project.org/objects.html) and [MISP warning-lists](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists/) have been updated to the latest version.

We would like to thank all the contributors, reporters and users who have helped us in the past months to improve MISP and information sharing at large.

As always, a detailed and [complete changelog is available](https://www.misp-project.org/Changelog.txt) with all the fixes, changes and improvements.
