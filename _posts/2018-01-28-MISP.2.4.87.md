A new version of MISP [2.4.87](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.87) has been released including a huge contribution to better support internationalisation and localisation in MISP UI (a huge thank to Steve Clement of CIRCL for the tedious work), many improvements in the UI, feed and API including bug fixes and speed improvements.

The feed now supports the ability to add any arbitrary HTTP headers which can be used to cache and get feeds from feed providers with authentication. A basic authentication widget has been added to easily add
authentication header to a feed. Feed providers are more than welcome to contact us, if they would like to have their feed metadata added in the default MISP installation.

The MISP ZMQ publish-subscribe channel has been extended with a new specific channel for all activities related to [tags](https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html).

[Warning-list](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists) can now support a regular expression type in addition to the string, substring, hostname and CIDR types. This allows the creation of versatile type of warning-lists which can be used to filter false-positive at API level (using the `enforcewarninglist` option in the API) and to limit the export of false-positives.

MISP automatic upgrade model has been improved to decouple DB changes from MISP version number allowing a more flexible upgrade model.

Free-text import improved to support automatic category switching based on currently selected types make it more easy for users.

Speed-up improvement in the logging view and tag view, it's way faster.

Many bug fixes and improvement were introduced in this version. The full change log is available [here](https://www.misp.software/Changelog.txt). [PyMISP change log](https://www.misp.software/PyMISP-Changelog.txt) is also available.

PyMISP has been improved with additional tests. The PyMISP documentation has been updated [PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pymisp/latest/pymisp.pdf).

MISP [galaxy](/galaxy.pdf), [objects](/objects.pdf) and [taxonomies](/taxonomies.pdf) were notably extended by many contributors. These are also included by default in MISP. Don't forget to do a `git submodule update` and update galaxies, objects and taxonomies via the UI.

We have many trainings and events foreseen in the next weeks, feel free to have a look at [our events page](/events/).
