The Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis, a phase-based model developed by Lockheed Martin, aims to help categorise and identify the stage of an attack.

=== Adversary
==== diamond-model:Adversary

diamond-model:An adversary is the actor/organization responsible for utilizing a capability against the victim to achieve their intent.

=== Capability
==== diamond-model:Capability

diamond-model:The capability describes the tools and/or techniques of the adversary used in the event. It includes all means to affect the victim from the most manual “unsophisticated” methods (e.g., manual password guessing) to the most sophisticated automated techniques.

=== Infrastructure
==== diamond-model:Infrastructure

diamond-model:The infrastructure feature describes the physical and/or logical communication structures the adversary uses to deliver a capability, maintain control of capabilities (e.g., commandand-control/C2), and effect results from the victim (e.g., exfiltrate data). As with the other features, the infrastructure can be as specific or broad as necessary. Examples include: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names, e-mail addresses, Morse code flashes from a phone’s voice-mail light watched from across a street, USB devices found in a parking lot and inserted into a workstation, or the compromising emanations from hardware (e.g., Van Eck Phreaking) being collected by a nearby listening post.

=== Victim
==== diamond-model:Victim

diamond-model:A victim is the target of the adversary and against whom vulnerabilities and exposures are exploited and capabilities used. A victim can be described in whichever way necessary and appropriate: organization, person, target email address, IP address, domain, etc. However, it is useful to define the victim persona and their assets separately as they serve different analytic functions. Victim personae are useful in non-technical analysis such as cyber-victimology and social-political centered approaches whereas victim assets are associated with common technical approaches such as vulnerability analysis..

== kill-chain
NOTE: kill-chain namespace available in JSON format at https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/kill-chain/machinetag.json[*this location*]. The JSON format can be freely reused in your application or automatically enabled in https://www.github.com/MISP/MISP[MISP] taxonomy.

The Cyber Kill Chain, a phase-based model developed by Lockheed Martin, aims to help categorise and identify the stage of an attack.

=== Reconnaissance
==== kill-chain:Reconnaissance

kill-chain:Research, identification and selection of targets, often represented as crawling Internet websites such as conference proceedings and mailing lists for email addresses, social relationships, or information on specific technologies.

=== Weaponisation
==== kill-chain:Weaponisation

kill-chain:Coupling a remote access trojan with an exploit into a deliverable payload, typically by means of an automated tool (weaponizer). Increasingly, client application data files such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) or Microsoft Office documents serve as the weaponized deliverable.

=== Delivery
==== kill-chain:Delivery

kill-chain:Transmission of the weapon to the targeted environment. The three most prevalent delivery vectors for weaponized payloads by APT actors, as observed by the Lockheed Martin Computer Incident Response Team (LM-CIRT) for the years 2004-2010, are email attachments, websites, and USB removable media.

=== Exploitation
==== kill-chain:Exploitation

kill-chain:After the weapon is delivered to victim host, exploitation triggers intruders' code. Most often, exploitation targets an application or operating system vulnerability, but it could also more simply exploit the users themselves or leverage an operating system feature that auto-executes code.

=== Installation
==== kill-chain:Installation

kill-chain:Installation of a remote access trojan or backdoor on the victim system allows the adversary to maintain persistence inside the environment.

=== Command and Control
==== kill-chain:Command and Control

kill-chain:Typically, compromised hosts must beacon outbound to an Internet controller server to establish a C2 channel. APT malware especially requires manual interaction rather than conduct activity automatically. Once the C2 channel establishes, intruders have 'hands on the keyboard' access inside the target environment.

=== Actions on Objectives
==== kill-chain:Actions on Objectives

kill-chain:Only now, after progressing through the first six phases, can intruders take actions to achieve their original objectives. Typically, this objective is data exfiltration which involves collecting, encrypting and extracting information from the victim environment; violations of data integrity or availability are potential objectives as well. Alternatively, the intruders may only desire access to the initial victim box for use as a hop point to compromise additional systems and move laterally inside the network.

== tlp
NOTE: tlp namespace available in JSON format at https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/tlp/machinetag.json[*this location*]. The JSON format can be freely reused in your application or automatically enabled in https://www.github.com/MISP/MISP[MISP] taxonomy.

The Traffic Light Protocol - or short: TLP - was designed with the objective to create a favorable classification scheme for sharing sensitive information while keeping the control over its distribution at the same time.

=== red
==== tlp:red

tlp:(TLP:RED) Information exclusively and directly given to (a group of) individual recipients. Sharing outside is not legitimate.


tlp:Not for disclosure, restricted to participants only. Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon by additional parties, and could lead to impacts on a party's privacy, reputation, or operations if misused. Recipients may not share TLP:RED information with any parties outside of the specific exchange, meeting, or conversation in which it was originally disclosed. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting. In most circumstances, TLP:RED should be exchanged verbally or in person.

=== amber
==== tlp:amber

tlp:(TLP:AMBER) Information exclusively given to an organization; sharing limited within the organization to be effectively acted upon.


tlp:Limited disclosure, restricted to participants’ organizations. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risks to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations involved. Recipients may only share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organization, and with clients or customers who need to know the information to protect themselves or prevent further harm. Sources are at liberty to specify additional intended limits of the sharing: these must be adhered to.

=== green
==== tlp:green

tlp:(TLP:GREEN) Information given to a community or a group of organizations at large. The information cannot be publicly released.


tlp:Limited disclosure, restricted to the community. Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful for the awareness of all participating organizations as well as with peers within the broader community or sector. Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organizations within their sector or community, but not via publicly accessible channels. Information in this category can be circulated widely within a particular community. TLP:GREEN information may not be released outside of the community.

=== white
==== tlp:white

tlp:(TLP:WHITE) Information can be shared publicly in accordance with the law.


tlp:Disclosure is not limited.  Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without restriction.

=== ex:chr
==== tlp:ex:chr

tlp:(TLP:EX:CHR) Information extended with a specific tag called Chatham House Rule (CHR). When this specific CHR tag is mentioned, the attribution (the source of information) must not be disclosed. This additional rule is at the discretion of the initial sender who can decide to apply or not the CHR tag.

It is critical that the CSIRT provide consistent and timely response to the customer, and that sensitive information is handled appropriately.  This document provides the guidelines needed for CSIRT Incident Managers (IM) to classify the case category, criticality level, and sensitivity level for each CSIRT case.  This information will be entered into the Incident Tracking System (ITS) when a case is created.  Consistent case classification is required for the CSIRT to provide accurate reporting to management on a regular basis.  In addition, the classifications will provide CSIRT IM’s with proper case handling procedures and will form the basis of SLA’s between the CSIRT and other Company departments.
