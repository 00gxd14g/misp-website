# MISP Training Video December Edition - Workflow 

{{< youtube OyLE2g4zii0 >}}

MISP has been a widely used open source CTI platform for the past decade, with a long list of tools that allow users to customise the data models and contextualisation of the platform, yet true customisation of the actual workflows and processes had to be done externally using custom scripts.

With the introduction of MISP workflows, this has changed and the workshop aims to walk the audience through some of the potential ideas of how one could adapt the tool to their own CSIRT’s or SOC’s workflows by using some useful examples during the session.
