									<h2>Features of MISP, the open source threat sharing platform.</h2>
									<p>A platform for sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromises of targeted attacks.

Discover how MISP is used today in multiple organisations. Not only to store, share, collaborate on malware, but also to use the IOCs to detect and prevent attacks. </p>

<ul>
                <li> An <strong>efficient IOC and indicators</strong> database allowing to store technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence.
                <li> Automatic <strong>correlation</strong> finding relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attacks campaigns or analysis.
                <li> Built-in <strong>sharing functionality</strong> to ease data sharing using different model of distributions. MISP can synchronize automatically events and attributes among different MISP. Advanced filtering functionalities can be used to meet each organization sharing policy including a <strong>flexible sharing group</strong> capacity and an attribute level distribution mechanisms.
                <li> An <strong>intuitive user-interface</strong> for end-users to create, update and collaborate on events and attributes/indicators. A <strong>graphical interface</strong> to navigate seamlessly between events and their correlations. Advanced filtering functionalities and <a href="https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists">warning list</a> to help the analysts to contribute events and attributes.
                <li> <strong>storing data</strong> in a structured format (allowing automated use of the database for various purposes) with an extensive support of cyber security indicators along fraud indicators as in the financial sector.
                <li> <strong>export</strong>: generating IDS, OpenIOC, plain text, CSV, MISP XML or JSON output to integrate with other systems (network IDS, host IDS, custom tools)
                <li> <strong>import</strong>: bulk-import, batch-import, import from OpenIOC, GFI sandbox, ThreatConnect CSV.
                <li> Flexible <strong>free text import</strong> tool to ease the integration of unstructured reports into MISP.
                <li> A gentle system to <strong>collaborate</strong> on events and attributes allowing MISP users to propose changes or updates to attributes/indicators.
                <li> <strong>data-sharing</strong>: automatically exchange and synchronization with other parties and trust-groups using MISP.
                <li> <strong>delegating of sharing</strong>: allows a simple pseudo-anonymous mechanism to delegate publication of event/indicators to another organization.
                <li> Flexible <strong>API</strong> to integrate MISP with your own solutions. MISP is bundled with <a href="https://github.com/MISP/PyMISP">PyMISP</a> which is a flexible Python Library to fetch, add or update events attributes, handle malware samples or search for attributes.
                <li> <strong>Adjustable taxonomy</strong> to classify and tag events following your own classification schemes or <a href="https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies">existing taxonomies</a>. The taxonomy can be local to your MISP but also shareable among MISP instances.
                <li> <strong>Expansion modules in Python</strong> to expand MISP with your own services or activate already available <a href="https://github.com/MISP/misp-modules">misp-modules</a>.
                <li> <strong>Sighting support</strong> to get observations from organizations concerning shared indicators and attributes. Sighting <a href="https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/index.html#sightings-api">can be contributed</a> via MISP user-interface, API as MISP document or STIX sighting documents.</li>
                <li> <strong>STIX support</strong>: export data in the STIX format (XML and JSON).</li>
                <li> <strong>Integrated encryption and signing of the notifications</strong> via PGP and/or S/MIME depending of the user preferences.</li>
