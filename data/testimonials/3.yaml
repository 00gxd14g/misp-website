text: "In a continuous effort since 2016, [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu) frequently gives practical training sessions about MISP. The purpose is to reach out to security analysts using MISP as a threat intelligence platform along with users using it as an information sharing platform.\n\n 
All the [training materials](https://github.com/MISP/misp-training) are open source, include slides and a virtual machine preconfigured with the latest version of MISP. [Reach out](professional-services) if you are looking for custom training."
