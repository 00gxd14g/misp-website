description: "Sharing is key to fast and effective detection of attacks. Quite often similar organizations are targeted by the same Threat Actor, in the same or different Campaign. MISP will make it easier for you to share with, but also to receive from trusted partners and trust-groups. Sharing also enabled collaborative analysis and prevents you from doing the work someone else already did before.  \n [Join one of the existing MISP communities](communities)."
